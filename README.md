## Project Scope

### Development Environment 
For this project, I have chosen to use Node.js. The benefits of using Node.js is that lightweight JavaScript runtime enviroment. 

### Tools and Frameworks
The JavaScript framework I chose to use was `ReactJS` because it's facilitates with the virtual DOM. I also chose to incoporate `Babel` which is a JavaScript compiler that compiles code into a working version of JavaScript for browsers. The last thing I chose to incorporate was `WebPack` allowing me to bundle JavaScript files for usage in the browser.

### IDE
My favorite IDE to use for JavaScript is WebStorm which was created by JetBrains. The build in features of vi, command line, and autocompletion speed up the development process. 

### Workflow
To create feasible tasks and interations I have incorporated Jira Software. Jira Software has allowed me to plan, track, and manage the software I have developed. I have created a Scrum Board to create feasible iterations and allow me to track my progress. Setting up Jira Software on MacOS initially was confusing so I plan to create a tutorial how to set up with the localhost to help future developers
